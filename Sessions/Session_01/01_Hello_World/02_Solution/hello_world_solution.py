It is common amount the programming communities that everytime you start to learn a new programming
language you start by announcing it to the world.

The tradition dictates to print on your command line the sentece "Hello World!". In order to do this
you need to use in this file:

- print() function: It enables you to print message in your command line window
- "Hello World!" string: For now don't worry about what a string is, this will 
covered later in the workshops.

Make sure you the string within the function, i. e. the string (including the quotation marks)
between the function parenthesis.

To run the program type in your terminal:

python3 Session_01/01_Hello_World/02_Solution/hello_world_solution.py 

Make sure you're located at the Sessions folder
